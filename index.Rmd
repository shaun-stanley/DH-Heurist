## Research Question

*How does religion affect the amount and nature of conflict one commits?*

The main point of this question is understanding the nuances of conflict with respect to religion in various forms. This study will explore both conflict that results in oneâ€™s death as well as conflict that does not. We will first have a look at different motives behind conflict and how a religious motive compares to others. This can give us an interesting look at how religion played a part in conflict during the partition. As it is likely that the followers of one religion may be much higher than others, expressing the acts of conflict as a % will give us a much clearer picture. A % > 100 may suggest members of a particular religion seem to be overly violent based on the data input on heurist.

## Operationalize into Queries

1. Using the facets search builder on heurist, we narrow down the events in which conflict took place (this can be of any kind) and what the motivation behind that was.

2. Using the same, we explore the cause of death of characters with respect to religion. This gives us a good birds eye view of how many members of a particular religion are dying and also the reason behind it. We can assess if members of a particular religion faced more persecution than others in our analysis.

## Analysis

1. As we can clearly see from the first chart, **Religion** seems to be the primary motivating factor behind acts of conflict. Counts of conflict arising due to religious reasons, account for a whopping 50+ percent of the total counts in the chart. That means that even if we summed all the other conflicts (for whatever reason), they would amount to lesser than that due to religion. Another interesting observation is that conflict motivated by **Nation** is the 3 largest cause. While both **Religion** and **Nation** have been listed as different types in the data, we must also keep in mind that the partition itself was primarily driven by **Religion**, indicating there may be some correlation. The same has been indicated in the data visualization below:

2. From the second chart, we can see that the number of deaths in most religions barring **Hindu**, **Muslim**, and **Sikh** is negligible. While this makes sense for Hindu's and Muslim's, as both of them form the majority of population in India (both divided as well as undivided), the high number of Sikh deaths may seem surprising. However, this is explained by the fact that a large percentage of people from the partition (Punjab, states belonged to the Sikh community.

3. 32.79% of the total deaths were **Muslims**. This is abnormally high, considering it is 80% higher than the number of **Hindu** deaths and 100% higher than the **Sikh** deaths. A reason for this could possibly be a higher **Muslim** population (we will inquire this thoroughly in the next analysis).

4. As we can see in the above chart, the a lot of our suspicions were in fact, correct. The 80% higher number of **Muslim** deaths than **Hindus"** is explained by the 100% larger number of characters that it boasts. Surprisingly though, this brings into light that the proportion of **Hindu** deaths to its population is 1/4 higher than that of **Muslims**, suggesting they may have suffered more during the events of the partition. Of course, this could also be merely because of the events that have been included in the **data set**, but a 20% higher number definitely stands out. The way we come to this conclusion is that **Muslim** population accounts for 32.X% of the population, as well as 32.X% of total deaths, whereas **Hindu** population accounts for 16.X% of the total population and 19.X% of the total deaths. However, we should also investigate the country a person was born in (Pakistan/India), as that's more likely to give us a better picture since **Pakistan** predominantly has a **Muslim** population, whereas **India** has a **Hindu** one.

5. What's surprising is that the number of **Muslims** born in **India** is higher than that in **Pakistan**, and the number of **Hindus** born in **Pakistan** is higher than those born in **India**. This completely throws off our assumption that **Pakistan** would have more **Muslims**, and **India** would have a higher population of **Hindus**. Inquiring using the facet builder in heurist also does not seem to give us data using which we could accurately infer why this is, as our assumption is based on statistics that stand completely true in the concurrent. So far, nothing seems to have explained in definite numerical terms the higher death rate of **Hindus** as compared to **Muslims**. We can still however, explore the location of said events, as that could also give us a clue as to why that is.

6. Unfortunately, this also seems to be a dead end, since the number of events that take place in **India** are **25%** higher than those taking place in **Pakistan**. This again, does not explain the higher death rate of **Hindus**, as based on our previous data, we found that a higher number of **Hindus** were born in **Pakistan** as opposed to **India**.
