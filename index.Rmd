## Research Question

*How does religion affect the amount and nature of conflict one commits?*

The main point of this question is understanding the nuances of conflict with respect to religion in various forms. This study will explore both conflict that results in oneâ€™s death as well as conflict that does not. We will first have a look at different motives behind conflict and how a religious motive compares to others. This can give us an interesting look at how religion played a part in conflict during the partition. As it is likely that the followers of one religion may be much higher than others, expressing the acts of conflict as a % will give us a much clearer picture. A % > 100 may suggest members of a particular religion seem to be overly violent based on the data input on heurist.
